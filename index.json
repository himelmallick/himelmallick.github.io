Little did I know that I would revisit this post 9 years down the lane. As it turns out, it\u0026rsquo;s not a bad idea to revisit old work with fresh eyes and new perspectives, which is what I have attempted to do here based on personal experience.\nWithout further ado, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about a typical data science project and let\u0026rsquo;s break it down into a few possible scenarios and their consequences (hint: the reality is always in between).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first look at the diagonal elements of the oversimplified 2x2 table above:\n Perfect data + perfect science: Win-win\n Imperfect data + imperfect science: Lose-lose\n  It\u0026rsquo;s a no brainer that the combination of perfect data and perfect science is the most desirable scenario for most data scientists and decision-makers. You don\u0026rsquo;t need a sophisticated method or model when your data is near-perfect (at least most of the time) - a simple visualization or a simple model might reveal what you are looking for (or a lack thereof).\nIn a similar vein, the least desirable scenario is the combination of near-garbage data and near-garbage science - not much to say here except that it\u0026rsquo;s unfortunate when that happens and a lose-lose scenario for everyone involved.\nNote that the above \u0026lsquo;garbage in garbage out\u0026rsquo; concept is possibly one of the most discussed topics in the data science community. Yet, this concept is often overused with misleading practical implications.\nQuite naturally, when a dataset is 100% garbage, the \u0026lsquo;garbage in garbage out\u0026rsquo; concept clearly stands out. Period. No further discussion is necessary. In reality, however, a dataset is never 100% garbage - it can be imperfect and noisy but not 100% garbage, which is when this concept gets tricky and ends up being misconstrued.\nTo understand this, let’s look at the other two scenarios (off-diagonal elements in the 2x2 table above) which is typically harder than the previous ones where the \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo; or the \u0026lsquo;statistical\u0026rsquo; aspect of \u0026lsquo;data science\u0026rsquo; can no longer be taken out of the equation unlike the \u0026lsquo;diagonal\u0026rsquo; use cases discussed before:\n Perfect data + Imperfect science: Highly undesirable. The damage might be less visible given the rich amount of information but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to justify the missed opportunity.\n Imperfect data + perfect science: Real test of a data scientist as uncertainty quantification is no longer optional. When successful, it\u0026rsquo;s a near-win for everyone involved.\n  As a data scientist, I thrive for a scenario when the data is imperfect which lets me test my mettle and let me break out of my comfort zone albeit at the expense of complexity, which can act as a barrier to wide acceptance and recognition. On the other hand, I have remained equally enthusiastic when the associated data is near-perfect which provided me an extra layer of cushion to posit a simpler but more impactful data science solution.\nThis brings me to the central point of this post. Amidst the natural human tendency to be safe, certain, and stress-free, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to forget the key word in data science which is not \u0026lsquo;data\u0026rsquo; but \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo; even in the situation when the data is imperfect.\nIn many cases, this \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo; entails \u0026lsquo;advanced statistics and machine learning\u0026rsquo; (and sometimes mathematical and computational innovations) and doing science on imperfectly collected data is astronomically harder than any of the above-mentioned \u0026lsquo;perfect data\u0026rsquo; scenarios.

A chain of abrupt COVID cancellations later, my much-awaited India trip finally materialized in April 2021 - little did I know that my spring sojourn was on the verge of becoming a lengthy nightmare.\nA few weeks into my arrival, a second wave of the global disease outbreak wreaked havoc across the nation. With a nearly collapsed health care system, India\u0026rsquo;s pandemic suddenly turned into a human tragedy in quick succession. As the difficult days unfolded, it was just a matter of time that the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the normal living, and I was no exception.\nThe unprecedented consequences of the pandemic have been widely reported in the media but there are a few things that personally affected me more than anything, which broadly manifested as a general decrease in productivity at the expense of regular mental and emotional breakdowns, including but not limited to:\n Insurmountable personal losses (It\u0026rsquo;s one thing to read the news or track the worldometer, but it\u0026rsquo;s a whole different ballgame to witness personal losses up close and personal and hear individual stories that are beyond heartbreaking.)\n Delayed academic collaborations (As much as I wanted to keep the 2020 momentum going, pandemic burnout turned out to be real, which slowly but surely led to an inevitable slowdown in productiveness.)\n COVID diagnosis with moderate-to-severe symptoms (A massive turning point was testing postive for COVID-19 with fairly severe symptoms. Although I was fortunate to escape a visit to the hospital (thanks to Favipiravir), the experience of end-to-end recovery was gruesome.)\n Immigration uncertainty and travel ban (An icing on the cake was immigration uncertainty induced by closures of consulates and embassies and the subsequent travel ban (not to forget the curfews and lockdown measures from time to time). I mean nothing more painful than having a confirmed interview appointment, and then finding out that it was cancelled only after traveling 1000 miles. All in all, it took 5 months, several round-trip flights, and multiple letters and email exchanges to finally secure a VISA interview in the capital.)\n Aftermath of Hurricane Ida (The final nail in the coffin came in the form of Hurricane Ida when I was able to finally return to the US in September 2021. In case you are wondering, life without a car in New Jersey is not as manageable as in other states, which is precisely why the experience of becoming a victim of a flooded out car (declared total loss by insurance) is not a great one. This was further exacerbated by an expired driver\u0026rsquo;s license and shortage of new cars in the area, adding to the worry and already-mounting anxiety).\n  As I come in terms with a particularly difficult year and reflect, there are a number of positive things that I am grateful for, which in turn made the journey a lot more easier:\n A long overdue family reunion and precious quality time with the extended family Completion of a six-month-long leadership course \u0026gt;10K official downloads of our software tool (MaAsLin 2) \u0026gt;100 Publons-verified reviews and \u0026gt;2500 Google Scholar citations Back-to-back keynote presentations including an extremely fulfilling BVCN featured talk Promotion to Associate Principal Scientist at work  To sum it up, instead of dwelling on the negatives, I made a solemn pledge this year to embrace things that didn\u0026rsquo;t go well in 2021, which in retrospect, was precisely what I needed to press that reset button and start the new year on a high note!

From delivering vaccines in record time to abiding by the social distancing guidelines to adjusting to the new normal, we have come a stunningly long way in a short period of time, which I believe, prepares us well for a pandemic-proof future in 2021 and beyond.\nHere are some things that went surprisingly well during the entire thriving process:\nNew year resolutions One of my new year resolutions in 2020 was to write at least one piece of writing every month (technical or non-technical). This seemed like a lofty goal at the outset but I am glad that I was able to break this seemingly hard-to-attain goal into manageable chunks to make it a reality. In my mind, this was a monumental personal milestone as it allowed me to build a decent writing habit which has been difficult historically.\n\u0026gt;10000 steps per day Another seemingly unattainable habit (based on past experiences) was consistently hitting an average \u0026gt;10,000 steps a day for an extended period of time (i.e. more than a few weeks or months), which I was able to achieve despite the almost year round lockdown. Considering all the obstacles that stood in the way this year, it was a truly transformative experience to start 2021 on a lighter note!\nGetting back into creative writing Towards the end of the year, I was fortunate to enroll in a screenwriting class. Among other things, this was my best chance at getting back into creative writing. As a result of this experience, I was able to write a few short scripts in addition to a few amateur poems which was enough to eventually claw my way to get my writer’s groove back :)\nPersonal commit record In the meantime, almost accidentally, I broke my own record of GitHub commits, which was more than all the previous years combined. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more happy about this unexpected milestone!\nPersonal peer-review record By the same token, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more appreciative of the opportunity to give back to the scientific community through voluntary contributions in the form of peer-review activities. Consequently, I was able to break my own record of Publons-verified peer-reviews, which was again accidentally more than all previous years.\nApart from these, there have been a few first-of-its-kind professional highlights this year as well:\n Completed my first internship as a mentor Edited my first special issue as a lead editor Published my first Bioconductor package Delivered my first keynote presentation Organized my first JSM invited session (scheduled for JSM 2021)  With that note, I would love to hear your highlights from the year, so be sure to leave a comment :)\nWishing you and yours a safe, healthy, and prosperous new year!

A quick Google search with _____ that changed my life (fill in the blank with your favorite) reveals that there is a growing list of such curated lists separately for books, movies, and what not but not too many dedicated to research papers.\nThis Thanksgiving, I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the authors of the most influential paper (snapshotted below) that changed my life in one way or another.\nHere are the Five Ws that form the crux of the story:\nWho?\nYours truly - A freshly minted PhD candidate of Biostatistics desperately seeking a dissertation topic that has sufficient methodological challenges but at the same time is motivated by real-world problems.\nWhen?\nJanuary 2011 - just after passing the PhD qualifying examination, with no prior research experience under my belt and only a vague idea of what Bayesian statistics is.\nWhere?\nDepartment of Biostatistics, University of Alabama at Birmingham - this is the place where I shopped for research topics across disciplines ranging from statistical genetics to clinical trials methodology and survival analysis to nonparametric inference.\nWhat?\nPlot point - Thanks to my advisor, I came across The Bayesian LASSO paper by Park and Casella which also happens to be the first paper that I read word by word multiple times.\nWhy?\nThe eureka effect - Such was the impact of this paper that I ended up choosing Bayesian regularization as my dissertation topic. In hindsight, this is a decision that I am immensely proud of as it offered a right balance of theory and methods which was tricky in a predominantly applied and non-Bayesian department.\nFrom a purely technical and objective standpoint, drawbacks and disadvantages aside, what makes the seminal work by Park and Casella (2008) an important paper in the literature is that it is the first successful (nontrivial) Bayesian hierarchical model formulation of the state-of-the-art LASSO method and it is the first Bayesian work that successfully demonstrated the advantage of doing Bayesian inference over the frequentist LASSO.\nThanks to the authors of this paper, we now have an exciting line of research (partially inspired by the methodological advances in this paper and a few other papers that followed), motivating researchers around the world to develop scalabale and interpretable Bayesian machine learning models that are able to accurately quantify uncertainty, a critical component of modern data-driven decision-making in the era of big data.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s your turn! What are the papers that you are thankful for?

In this post, I will go over the steps required to automatically import Google Scholar citation metrics in a LaTeX document without any hassle or compromise.\nMotivation Similar to Part I, here are just a few things I would like to maintain:\n Ability to edit CVs and resumes in LaTeX, Without the need to learn a new language or markup syntax, and Without falling back to a manual update which can be inconvenient.  As before, here are a few things we will need: (i) A CV or resume written in LaTeX (.tex), (ii) R, and (iii) RStudio. Information about installing R and RStudio is here (it\u0026rsquo;s free!). This tutorial also assumes that you have an up-to-date Google Scholar profile. All files described in this tutorial are publicly available.\nCompared to the previous post, this tutorial is more straightforward, thanks to the well-developed Sweave function, that enables effortless integration of R code into LaTeX documents, allowing one to execute and embed the results of R computations and graphics within a LaTeX document.\nWithout further ado, here goes the quick 3-step solution.\nStep 1: Customizing the LaTeX Document First step is to convert the existing LaTeX (.tex) document into a Sweave file (.Rnw) by simply changing the extension.\nStep 2: Adding a minimal R code Next, add the following R chunk in your .Rnw document (anywhere between \\begin{document} and \\end{document}):\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;echo=FALSE\u0026gt;\u0026gt;= library(scholar) my_Google_Scholar\u0026lt;-get_profile('twbXG-wAAAAJ') a\u0026lt;-my_Google_Scholar$total_cites b\u0026lt;-my_Google_Scholar$h_index c\u0026lt;-my_Google_Scholar$i10_index @  In the above code, I have used my own Google Scholar ID twbXG-wAAAAJ. Please don\u0026rsquo;t forget to modify to yours. You also need to call out these extracted values (a, b, and c) using the \\Sexpr command in the LaTeX document as follows:\nCitations = \\Sexpr{a} h-index = \\Sexpr{b} i-10 index = \\Sexpr{c}  That\u0026rsquo;s it. Now you can compile this file directly from RStudio by simply executing the Compile PDF button on the right:\nFor your reference, the snapshot above is from my own resume which can be downloaded from here.\n(Optional) Step 3: Automating with cron Once the Steps 1 and 2 are in place, it\u0026rsquo;s as easy as pie to automate this further. In particular, you can follow the exact same steps from Part I tutorial to set up a cron job, with a few ramifications, as detailed below.\nThe code above assumes that Resume_Master is the master file that you intend to update and Resume_Final is the final document, whereas the Resume_Master-knitr is an intermediate file. After you execute these steps, a PDF named Resume_Final.pdf with the appended Google Scholar citation metrics will be produced.\nI have not tested the above code chunk myself but please feel free to relay any comments, suggestions, or corrections my way if you encounter any issues.\nHappy Tuesday!

In this post, I will go over the steps required to automatically import Google Scholar citation metrics in a LaTeX document without any hassle or compromise.\nMotivation Similar to Part I, here are just a few things I would like to maintain:","tags":["R","Resume","Career"],"title":"Automatically update citation metrics in your CV with a bare minimum script - Part II","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" The inspiration behind this post comes from my non-computational scientist colleagues who simply wanted to import Google Scholar citation metrics in their CVs and resumes with as little overhead as possible. After a few quick searches, several solutions popped up that used either Markdown or LaTeX. While I appreciate these more sophisticated maneuvers, they did not serve any useful purpose for my specific motivation as described below.\nMotivation There are just a few things my scientist colleagues wanted to achieve:\n Ability to edit their CVs and resumes in Microsoft Word, Without the need to learn a new language or markup syntax, and Without falling back to a manual update which can be inconvenient.  Fortunately, the R community has already done much of the hard work, thanks to the awesome officer and scholar packages. Briefly, the officer package lets users manipulate Word documents without altering the contents, styles, and properties of the original document, while the scholar package provides handy functions to extract citation data from Google Scholar.\nAmong other things, I wanted this solution to be a bit more robust without being too complicated for future expansion. In particular, the possibility of adding other elements above and beyond citation metrics such as images, tables, and text from R as well as portability to other documents such as PowerPoint (*.pptx) was on the top of my list. Beyond everything, I wanted to make this exercise as seamless and efficient as possible for my scientist colleagues irrespective of their coding background.\nBefore getting started, here are a few things we will need: (i) A CV or resume written in Word (.docx), (ii) R, and (iii) RStudio. Information about installing R and RStudio is here (it\u0026rsquo;s free!). This tutorial also assumes that you have an up-to-date Google Scholar profile. All files described in this tutorial are publicly available.\nSo, here goes the simple 3-step solution.\nStep 1: Customizing the Word Document For illustration purposes, I will use a template resume named Resume_Master.docx which is mostly empty at this point:\nThe first step is to add a bookmark where you want to insert your citation metrics. If you are unfamiliar with bookmarks in Word documents, I suggest reading the Microsoft Office tutorial which is pretty concise and hence skipped here. For our specific task, I want to define three bookmarks right after the Publications section as follows:\nIn particular, I intend to import total citation counts, h-index, and i10 index on these pre-defined bookmarks GS_a, GS_b, and GS_c respectively, as verified by the bookmark window on the right.\nStep 2: Running a minimal R script This step is actually pretty simple as long as you know how to run a script in RStudio. A quick breakdown of what this bare minimum script (Update_Resume.R) does is as follows.\nFirst, it installs and loads the required packages. In the second chunk of the code, it extracts the relevant Google Scholar citation metrics (make sure you have an internet connection while executing this part). Here I have used my own Google Scholar ID twbXG-wAAAAJ (don\u0026rsquo;t forget to change to yours). Finally, it inserts these metrics into your input Word Document (in this case Resume_Master.docx) and outputs an updated document called Resume_Final.docx. With my own humble contribution to science, the resulting file looks something like this (last retrieved on February 16, 2020):\nPlease note that, this script assumes that all the associated files are co-located in the same directory. Please make sure to change the names of your input and output files in this script as desired before executing.\nThe cool thing is that you can seamlessly edit your master file as you would normally do and run this script as frequently as you want to get the citations metrics inserted automatically.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! You have the exact same resume with the citation metrics inserted.\n(Optional) Step 3: Automating with cron Now, if you would like to further fine-tune this process without the hassle of running the script every other day, you can optionally do that thanks to the amazing cronR package. Fortunately, this step is dead easy as well, especially if you are already familar with R.\nIn particular, once you are able to install the cronR package following instructions here, you can jump right into the RStudio add-in section of that tutorial.\nAs an example, if you want to execute the Update_Resume.R script hourly, all you have to do is the following before pressing the Create job button:\nOnce you schedule the job above, it will update every hour whenever your computer is switched on (you can change the schedule any time). You can also save the resulting file in a shared or publicly accessible folder (such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive) and easily embed it on your personal website if you would like.\nHappy automating! It\u0026rsquo;s not that difficult after all :)\n","date":1581829200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581829200,"objectID":"621b0989deb5f3f6d228b4368dc6ecc1","permalink":"http://himelmallick.github.io/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume/","section":"post","summary":"The inspiration behind this post comes from my non-computational scientist colleagues who simply wanted to import Google Scholar citation metrics in their CVs and resumes with as little overhead as possible.
