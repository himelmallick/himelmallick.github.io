      <title>Retrospective h-index - A simple R function</title>
      <link>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/retro_h_index/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The inspiration behind this post comes from an ongoing `citation analysis&amp;rsquo; side project, where I wanted to calculate h-index of a researcher based on their Google Scholar profile retrospectively. Easy peasy except the following two issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet tells me no readily available solution currently exists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ChatGPT was not quite able to solve it either&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ChatGPT was able to efficiently turn my R function into a Shiny code, it failed to provide me the solution I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the journey to get this work published was a bit bumpy, which happened to be an instance of early-career setback (broadly defined), an almost-unheard-of phenomenon until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I wanted to achieve the following 5-step workflow where ChatGPT was not super helpful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step I - Get a data frame of publications and citation history for a given Google Scholar ID&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step II - Slice citation history to remove publications beyond the given window&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step III - Correct total cites per article in the reduced data frame (On the reduced data frame we still don&amp;rsquo;t have the current number of citations per article for the given window as it has the total citation counts by default)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step IV - On the corrected reduced data frame, calculate the retrospective h-index using the h-index formula&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step V- Output current and retro h-index&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting to the chase, here is the simple R function that achieves this objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Google limits how frequently you can connect with the Google Scholar server, making the code inefficient for a Shiny app. Nevertheless, a work-in-progress Shiny app is also available which is open for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yearender: Looking back at 2021</title>
      <link>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/yearender_2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/yearender_2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year a set of memes is circulated widely on social media, the 2022 version of which goes along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;My goal for 2022 is to accomplish the goals of 2021 which I should have done in 2020 because I made a promise in 2019 and planned in 2018.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, this remained my most favorite ‘new year’ meme for no real reason other than that it was hilarious, funny, and relatable, but in 2021, the actuality of these lines hit me hard as it tested my mettle out and out by bestowing a series of unfinished businesses and frequent hiccups throughout the year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline of this blog post spans approximately two pandemic years (2020-2021) as it dates back to my planned month-long India trip when the COVID-19 situation in India was better than what it was in the US (Fall, 2020). A chain of abrupt COVID cancellations later, my much-awaited India trip finally materialized in April 2021 - little did I know that my spring sojourn was on the verge of becoming a lengthy nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks into my arrival, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_April_2021&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a second wave of the  global disease outbreak&lt;/a&gt; wreaked havoc across the nation. With a nearly collapsed health care system, India&amp;rsquo;s pandemic suddenly turned into a human tragedy in quick succession. As the difficult days unfolded, it was just a matter of time that the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the normal living, and I was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented consequences of the pandemic have been widely reported in the media but there are a few things that personally affected me more than anything, which broadly manifested as a general decrease in productivity at the expense of regular mental and emotional breakdowns, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurmountable personal losses&lt;/strong&gt; (It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to read the news or track the worldometer, but it&amp;rsquo;s a whole different ballgame to witness personal losses up close and personal and hear individual stories that are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reuters.com/world/india/situation-india-beyond-heartbreaking-who-chief-says-2021-04-26/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;beyond heartbreaking&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed academic collaborations&lt;/strong&gt; (As much as I wanted to keep the &lt;a href=&#34;http://himelmallick.github.io/post/year_end_reflection_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2020 momentum&lt;/a&gt; going, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00663-2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pandemic burnout&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be real, which slowly but surely led to an inevitable slowdown in productiveness.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID diagnosis with moderate-to-severe symptoms&lt;/strong&gt; (A massive turning point was testing postive for COVID-19 with fairly severe symptoms. Although I was fortunate to escape a visit to the hospital (thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favipiravir&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Favipiravir&lt;/a&gt;), the experience of end-to-end recovery was gruesome.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immigration uncertainty and travel ban&lt;/strong&gt; (An icing on the cake was immigration uncertainty induced by closures of consulates and embassies and the subsequent travel ban (not to forget the curfews and lockdown measures from time to time). I mean nothing more painful than having a confirmed interview appointment, and then finding out that it was cancelled only after traveling 1000 miles. All in all, it took 5 months, several round-trip flights, and multiple letters and email exchanges to finally secure a VISA interview in the capital.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath of Hurricane Ida&lt;/strong&gt; (The final nail in the coffin came in the form of Hurricane Ida when I was able to finally return to the US in September 2021. In case you are wondering, life without a car in New Jersey is not as manageable as in other states, which is precisely why the experience of becoming a victim of a flooded out car (declared total loss by insurance) is not a great one. This was further exacerbated by an expired driver&amp;rsquo;s license and &lt;a href=&#34;https://nj1015.com/car-shopping-in-nj-right-now-is-a-nightmare-my-story-and-some-advice-opinion/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shortage of new cars in the area&lt;/a&gt;, adding to the worry and already-mounting anxiety).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I come in terms with a particularly difficult year and reflect, there are a number of positive things that I am grateful for, which in turn made the journey a lot more easier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A long overdue family reunion and precious quality time with the extended family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completion of a six-month-long &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ccl.org/leadership-programs/leadership-development-program/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;leadership course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;gt;10K &lt;a href=&#34;http://bioconductor.org/packages/stats/bioc/Maaslin2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;official downloads&lt;/a&gt; of our software tool (&lt;a href=&#34;https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/maaslin/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MaAsLin 2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;gt;100 &lt;a href=&#34;https://publons.com/researcher/1190507/himel-mallick/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Publons-verified reviews&lt;/a&gt; and &amp;gt;2500 &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=twbXG-wAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Scholar citations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back-to-back keynote presentations including an extremely fulfilling &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV_KRtMfqr0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BVCN featured talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promotion to Associate Principal Scientist at work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, instead of dwelling on the negatives, I made a solemn pledge this year to embrace things that didn&amp;rsquo;t go well in 2021, which in retrospect, was precisely what I needed to press that reset button and start the new year on a high note! Welcome, 2022!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Year-end reflection: My 2020 highlights</title>
      <link>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/year_end_reflection_2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/year_end_reflection_2020/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The last day of 2020 is finally here. To bring this decade to a close, I thought I would take a moment to share some of the highlights from this year in the form of pictures and anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I would love to remember this year as a year of &lt;code&gt;setbacks and bottlenecks&lt;/code&gt;, in retrospect, it has been packed with some very surprising yet noteworthy moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, 2020 has been a year of many firsts, much as has been the case for the society in general where we have together achieved incredible things as a community despite challenging circumstances. From delivering vaccines in record time to abiding by the social distancing guidelines to adjusting to the &lt;code&gt;new normal&lt;/code&gt;, we have come a stunningly long way in a short period of time, which I believe, prepares us well for a pandemic-proof future in 2021 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things that went surprisingly well during the entire thriving process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-year-resolutions&#34;&gt;New year resolutions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my new year resolutions in 2020 was to write at least one piece of writing every month (technical or non-technical). This seemed like a lofty goal at the outset but I am glad that I was able to break this seemingly hard-to-attain goal into manageable chunks to make it a reality. In my mind, this was a monumental personal milestone as it allowed me to build a decent writing habit which has been difficult historically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;10000-steps-per-day&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;10000 steps per day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another seemingly unattainable habit (based on past experiences) was consistently hitting an average &amp;gt;10,000 steps a day for an extended period of time (i.e. more than a few weeks or months), which I was able to achieve despite the almost year round lockdown. Considering all the obstacles that stood in the way this year, it was a truly transformative experience to start 2021 on a &lt;code&gt;lighter&lt;/code&gt; note!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-back-into-creative-writing&#34;&gt;Getting back into creative writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the year, I was fortunate to enroll in a &lt;code&gt;screenwriting&lt;/code&gt; class. Among other things, this was my best chance at getting back into creative writing. As a result of this experience, I was able to write a few short scripts in addition to a few amateur poems which was enough to eventually claw my way to get my writer’s groove back :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-commit-record&#34;&gt;Personal commit record&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, almost accidentally, I broke my own record of GitHub commits, which was more than all the previous years combined. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more happy about this &lt;code&gt;unexpected&lt;/code&gt; milestone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-peer-review-record&#34;&gt;Personal peer-review record&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the same token, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more appreciative of the opportunity to give back to the scientific community through voluntary contributions in the form of peer-review activities. Consequently, I was able to break my own record of &lt;a href=&#34;https://publons.com/researcher/1190507/himel-mallick/metrics/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Publons-verified peer-reviews&lt;/a&gt;, which was again &lt;code&gt;accidentally&lt;/code&gt; more than all previous years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these, there have been a few &lt;code&gt;first-of-its-kind&lt;/code&gt; professional highlights this year as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed my first internship as a mentor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited my first &lt;a href=&#34;https://himelmallick.github.io/post/guest_editing_reflection/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;special issue&lt;/a&gt; as a lead editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published my first &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Maaslin2.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bioconductor package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivered my first &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Mallick_Himel/status/1260271590320885764&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;keynote presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organized my first &lt;a href=&#34;https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2021/invitedsessions.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JSM invited session&lt;/a&gt; (scheduled for JSM 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that note, I would love to hear your highlights from the year, so be sure to leave a comment :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wishing you and yours a safe, healthy, and prosperous new year! Onwards and upwards!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A paper that changed my life - The Bayesian LASSO</title>
      <link>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/most_influential_paper/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As tough as this year has been, it goes without saying that 2020 is a particularly good year to be thankful for science, which happens to be one of the many things that are often &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-im-thankful-science-jeffrey-simmons&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;taken for granted&lt;/a&gt;. While similar &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2011/11/what-scientists-can-be-grateful-thanksgiving&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;thankfulness posts&lt;/a&gt; have appeared &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.criver.com/eureka/good-year-be-thankful-scientists&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, I want to share a different take as a computational scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, I am shamelessly borrowing idea from the so-called &lt;code&gt;most influential&lt;/code&gt; series that are widespread in the popular culture. A quick Google search with &lt;code&gt;_____ that changed my life&lt;/code&gt; (fill in the blank with your favorite) reveals that there is a growing list of such curated lists separately for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/opinion/letters/influential-books.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://deadline.com/2020/05/imdb-movies-that-changed-my-life-podcast-jeffrey-wright-1202927877/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt;, and what not but not too many dedicated to &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0216&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;research papers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Thanksgiving, I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the authors of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/016214508000000337&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;most influential paper&lt;/a&gt; (snapshotted below) that changed my life in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the Five Ws that form the crux of the story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours truly - A freshly minted PhD candidate of Biostatistics desperately seeking a dissertation topic that has sufficient methodological challenges but at the same time is motivated by real-world problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 2011 - just after passing the PhD qualifying examination, with no prior research experience under my belt and only a vague idea of what &lt;code&gt;Bayesian statistics&lt;/code&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/departments/biostatistics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Department of Biostatistics, University of Alabama at Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; - this is the place where I shopped for research topics across disciplines ranging from statistical genetics to clinical trials methodology and survival analysis to nonparametric inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_point&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Plot point&lt;/a&gt; - Thanks to my advisor, I came across &lt;code&gt;The Bayesian LASSO&lt;/code&gt; paper by Park and Casella which also happens to be the first paper that I read word by word multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The eureka effect&lt;/a&gt; - Such was the impact of this paper that I ended up choosing &lt;a href=&#34;https://search.proquest.com/openview/92eec79a977d0452b818c4b4871a0bf8/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;amp;cbl=18750&amp;amp;diss=y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bayesian regularization&lt;/a&gt; as my dissertation topic. In hindsight, this is a decision that I am immensely proud of as it offered a right balance of theory and methods which was tricky in a predominantly applied and non-Bayesian department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a purely technical and objective standpoint, drawbacks and disadvantages aside, what makes the seminal work by Park and Casella (2008) an important paper in the literature is that it is the first successful (nontrivial) Bayesian hierarchical model formulation of the state-of-the-art &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LASSO&lt;/a&gt; method and it is the first Bayesian work that successfully demonstrated the advantage of doing Bayesian inference over the frequentist LASSO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the authors of this paper, we now have an exciting line of research (partially inspired by the methodological advances in this paper and a few other papers that followed), motivating researchers around the world to develop scalabale and interpretable Bayesian machine learning models that are able to accurately quantify &lt;code&gt;uncertainty&lt;/code&gt;, a critical component of modern data-driven decision-making in the era of big data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s your turn! What are the papers that you are thankful for? What is that one &lt;code&gt;most influential&lt;/code&gt; paper that has significantly shaped your research life?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Student paper awards and travel grants - A resource for data science graduate students and postdocs</title>
      <link>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/travel_grant_resource/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/travel_grant_resource/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is motivated by the growing list of &lt;code&gt;awesome&lt;/code&gt; public repositories that curate a list of resources dedicated to a specific topic (such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dangkhoasdc/awesome-ai-residency&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, among others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, I often struggled to find such a centralized resource, especially when it comes to student paper awards and travel grants, geared towards data science graduate students and postdocs (broadly defined). On the surface, these awards help you save a few hundred dollars of registration and other out-of-pocket travel expenses but they are also worth the effort to go the extra mile in getting a nice gold star for a CV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Student-Paper-Competitions.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ASA&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://imstat.org/ims-awards/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IMS&lt;/a&gt; have already done a great job in gathering a subset of these opportunities in their respective websites. However, it has been difficult to quickly sort through the information with respect to several desirable aspects such as eligibility, deadline, coverage, and scope, as often difficult from multiple disparate data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these factors, I have assembled this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/himelmallick/awesome_datascience_travel_grants&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;public repository&lt;/a&gt; (a subset of this list is snapshotted below) as an attempt to aggregate and synthesize information related to statistics/biostatistics/data science travel awards and grants with a special emphasis on those geared towards early career researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of such opportunities, I would like this public repository to be an ongoing community effort with the hope that it serves the early-career data science community at large, and likewise, any of the following is welcome from the community members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New information you&amp;rsquo;d like to add (such as a new award information not already listed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inaccuracies in the content (e.g. deadline, eligibility, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information gaps in the content that need more details to be complete (e.g. broken links)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typos or grammatical errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to receiving your pull requests :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Celebrating milestones as a scientist</title>
      <link>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/on_celebrating_milestones/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/on_celebrating_milestones/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As scientists, we rarely celebrate &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2018/12/what-s-milestone-reflecting-life-scientist&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;milestones&lt;/a&gt; be it a certain number of citations we have received or a certain number of impactful papers/patents we have co-authored. This is in sharp contrast to other professions where it is customary to celebrate even the tiniest bit of success in numbers. Be it how many runs a Cricketer has scored (yes I am an ardent Cricket fan!) or the number of box office successes a filmmaker has delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us who are in a research scientist track know very well that peer-reviewed publications constitute the bread and butter of a researcher&amp;rsquo;s career. Of course, how much weight it carries varies from sector to sector, which can range from anywhere between 0% to 100%. Regardless of whether we are at the lower end of the spectrum (which is possibly true for many industry scientists) or the upper end of the spectrum (e.g. academics in research institutes), it is undeniable that much of the reputation a scientist builds is derived from their publications/patents/products and the associated impact they have on the greater scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to delve into the philosophical discussion of whether publications/patents/products are the only yardsticks to measure a scientist&amp;rsquo;s success. In stead, through this post, I want to embrace the importance of celebrating such milestones (however small that might seem) that define the trajectory of a scientist&amp;rsquo;s career. I truly hope that &amp;lsquo;celebration of milestones&amp;rsquo; becomes widespread in the science community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, September 2020 marks the milestone of 1000 Google Scholar citations which I believe is an important landmark for me even though it&amp;rsquo;s minuscule in the big scheme of things and I have miles to go before I sleep! This tiny feat wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible without my excellent collaborators, colleagues, friends, and mentors and I want to thank them all from the bottom of my heart!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early-career setback - A throwback to my first paper</title>
      <link>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/early_career_setback/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/early_career_setback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This 15th August marked 7 years since I submitted my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/sii/content/vols/0007/0004/a012/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;first paper&lt;/a&gt; (first-authored research article). Coincidentally, it also completed five calendar years last December, which gave me a chance to measure it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.clarivate.com/ScientificandAcademicResearch/s/article/Journal-Citation-Reports-5-Year-Impact-Factors?language=en_US&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;5-year impact&lt;/a&gt; (erring on the conservative side of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to see that it has been well-received as shown in the figure above (the R code to generate the plot is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/himelmallick/himelmallick.github.io/tree/master/post/early_career_setback&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;publicly available&lt;/a&gt;). To interpret it more accurately in plain English, it has performed significantly better than an average paper in the same journal or same discipline (Statistics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the journey to get this work published was a bit bumpy, which happened to be an instance of early-career setback (broadly defined), an almost-unheard-of phenomenon until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the overall roadmap of the paper (inspired by a &lt;a href=&#34;https://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/26977029850/my-worst-recent-experience-with-peer-review&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;similar post&lt;/a&gt; in a different context): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayesian Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Submitted  08/30/2012, rejected 09/16/2012.  Not much to say here, except that I am grateful for the rapid decision that helped me move on to the next journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computational-statistics-and-data-analysis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational Statistics and Data Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Submitted  09/20/2012, rejected 04/30/2013. This substantial delay was mentally agonizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jmlr.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal of Machine Learning Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Submitted 04/30/2013, rejected 08/15/2013 with some constructive and legitimate reviews that led to a substantive improvement of the manuscript later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/sii/_home/_main/index.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistics and Its Interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Submitted 08/15/2013, first review 12/09/2013, resubmitted 05/20/2014 (got delayed by a few other dissertation projects), second revision requested 06/27/2014, revised version submitted 06/30/2014, accepted 06/30/2014, published in final edited form 12/23/2014 (as snapshotted below). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, it was very hard not to take unreasonable reviews personally, especially in the absence of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12708&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;big names and prior experience in the author list&lt;/a&gt;, possibly more so as it felt like a never-ending process - both figuratively and literally!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I used a rather generous denominator of 4.2 while calculating the &lt;a href=&#34;http://help.prod-incites.com/inCites2Live/indicatorsGroup/aboutHandbook/usingCitationIndicatorsWisely/normalizedCitationImpact.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FWCI&lt;/a&gt; (excluding self-citations), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844016322800&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;which is only based on a handful of top journals in the field&lt;/a&gt;. Even going by the current impact factor of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/sii/_home/_main/index.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;publishing journal&lt;/a&gt; (~0.5), this is a gross overestimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I could not be more appreciative of how it has turned out despite appearing in a relatively low-impact journal in challenging circumstances. In hindsight, this early-career setback prepared me well for my future endeavors, consistent with the aphorism that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12189-3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;“what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK - that was my story. What is your early-career setback story?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automatically update citation metrics in your CV with a bare minimum script - Part II</title>
      <link>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume_2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Following my previous post (&lt;a href=&#34;https://himelmallick.github.io/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;), I received a few requests from my fellow mathematical and physical scientist colleagues who prepare their CVs and resumes in the popular typesetting system &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I will go over the steps required to automatically import Google Scholar citation metrics in a LaTeX document without any hassle or compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;a href=&#34;https://himelmallick.github.io/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;, here are just a few things I would like to maintain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to edit CVs and resumes in LaTeX,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without the need to learn a new language or markup syntax, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without falling back to a manual update which can be inconvenient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, here are a few things we will need: (i) A CV or resume written in LaTeX (.tex), (ii) &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;, and (iii) &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;. Information about installing R and RStudio is &lt;a href=&#34;https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.7.01x/3T2014/56c5437b88fa43cf828bff5371c6a924/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (it&amp;rsquo;s free!). This tutorial also assumes that you have an up-to-date &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt; profile. All files described in this tutorial are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/himelmallick/himelmallick.github.io/tree/master/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume_2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;publicly available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the previous post, this tutorial is more straightforward, thanks to the well-developed &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweave&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sweave function&lt;/a&gt;, that enables effortless integration of R code into LaTeX documents, allowing one to execute and embed the results of R computations and graphics within a LaTeX document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here goes the quick 3-step solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-customizing-the-latex-document&#34;&gt;Step 1: Customizing the LaTeX Document&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step is to convert the existing LaTeX (.tex) document into a Sweave file (.Rnw) by simply changing the extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-adding-a-minimal-r-code&#34;&gt;Step 2: Adding a minimal R code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, add the following R chunk in your &lt;code&gt;.Rnw&lt;/code&gt; document (anywhere between &lt;code&gt;\begin{document}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\end{document}&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;echo=FALSE&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=
library(scholar)
my_Google_Scholar&amp;lt;-get_profile(&#39;twbXG-wAAAAJ&#39;)
a&amp;lt;-my_Google_Scholar$total_cites
b&amp;lt;-my_Google_Scholar$h_index
c&amp;lt;-my_Google_Scholar$i10_index
@
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above code, I have used my own Google Scholar ID &lt;code&gt;twbXG-wAAAAJ&lt;/code&gt;. Please don&amp;rsquo;t forget to modify to yours. You also need to call out these extracted values (&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;) using the &lt;code&gt;\Sexpr&lt;/code&gt; command in the LaTeX document as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Citations = \Sexpr{a}
h-index = \Sexpr{b}
i-10 index = \Sexpr{c}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. Now you can compile this file directly from RStudio by simply executing the &lt;code&gt;Compile PDF&lt;/code&gt; button on the right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your reference, the snapshot above is from my own resume which can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&#34;http://himelmallick.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;optional-step-3-automating-with-cron&#34;&gt;(Optional) Step 3: Automating with cron&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Steps 1 and 2 are in place, it&amp;rsquo;s as easy as pie to automate this further. In particular, you can follow the exact same steps from &lt;a href=&#34;https://himelmallick.github.io/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; tutorial to set up a cron job, with a few ramifications, as detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code above assumes that &lt;code&gt;Resume_Master&lt;/code&gt; is the master file that you intend to update and &lt;code&gt;Resume_Final&lt;/code&gt; is the final document, whereas the &lt;code&gt;Resume_Master-knitr&lt;/code&gt; is an intermediate file. After you execute these steps, a PDF named &lt;code&gt;Resume_Final.pdf&lt;/code&gt; with the appended Google Scholar citation metrics will be produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not tested the above code chunk myself but please feel free to relay any comments, suggestions, or corrections my way if you encounter any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Tuesday! I hope you find this tutorial useful :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automatically update citation metrics in your CV with a bare minimum script - Part I</title>
      <link>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>http://himelmallick.github.io/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The inspiration behind this post comes from my non-computational scientist colleagues who simply wanted to import &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Scholar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt; citation metrics in their CVs and resumes with as little overhead as possible. After a few quick searches, several solutions popped up that used either &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;. While I appreciate these more sophisticated maneuvers, they did not serve any useful purpose for my specific motivation as described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are just a few things my scientist colleagues wanted to achieve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to edit their CVs and resumes in Microsoft Word,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without the need to learn a new language or markup syntax, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without falling back to a manual update which can be inconvenient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/06/r-community.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R community&lt;/a&gt; has already done much of the hard work, thanks to the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/officer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;officer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scholar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;scholar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; packages. Briefly, the &lt;code&gt;officer&lt;/code&gt; package lets users manipulate Word documents without altering the contents, styles, and properties of the original document, while the &lt;code&gt;scholar&lt;/code&gt; package provides handy functions to extract citation data from Google Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, I wanted this solution to be a bit more robust without being too complicated for future expansion. In particular, the possibility of adding other elements above and beyond citation metrics such as images, tables, and text from R as well as portability to other documents such as PowerPoint (*.pptx) was on the top of my list. Beyond everything, I wanted to make this exercise as seamless and efficient as possible for my scientist colleagues irrespective of their coding background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before getting started, here are a few things we will need: (i) A CV or resume written in Word (.docx), (ii) &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;, and (iii) &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;. Information about installing R and RStudio is &lt;a href=&#34;https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.7.01x/3T2014/56c5437b88fa43cf828bff5371c6a924/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (it&amp;rsquo;s free!). This tutorial also assumes that you have an up-to-date &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt; profile. All files described in this tutorial are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/himelmallick/himelmallick.github.io/tree/master/post/automate_citation_metrics_resume&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;publicly available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here goes the simple 3-step solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-customizing-the-word-document&#34;&gt;Step 1: Customizing the Word Document&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For illustration purposes, I will use a template resume named &lt;code&gt;Resume_Master.docx&lt;/code&gt; which is mostly empty at this point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to add a bookmark where you want to insert your citation metrics. If you are unfamiliar with bookmarks in Word documents,  I suggest reading the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-or-delete-bookmarks-in-a-word-document-or-outlook-message-f68d781f-0150-4583-a90e-a4009d99c2a0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Microsoft Office tutorial&lt;/a&gt; which is pretty concise and hence skipped here. For our specific task, I want to define three bookmarks right after the &lt;code&gt;Publications&lt;/code&gt; section as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I intend to import total citation counts, h-index, and i10 index on these pre-defined bookmarks &lt;code&gt;GS_a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;GS_b&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;GS_c&lt;/code&gt; respectively, as verified by the bookmark window on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-running-a-minimal-r-script&#34;&gt;Step 2: Running a minimal R script&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step is actually pretty simple as long as you know &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dummies.com/programming/r/how-to-source-a-script-in-r/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how to run a script in RStudio&lt;/a&gt;. A quick breakdown of what this bare minimum script (&lt;code&gt;Update_Resume.R&lt;/code&gt;) does is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_3.png&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it installs and loads the required packages. In the second chunk of the code, it extracts the relevant Google Scholar citation metrics (make sure you have an internet connection while executing this part). Here I have used my own Google Scholar ID &lt;code&gt;twbXG-wAAAAJ&lt;/code&gt; (don&amp;rsquo;t forget to change to yours). Finally, it inserts these metrics into your input Word Document (in this case &lt;code&gt;Resume_Master.docx&lt;/code&gt;) and outputs an updated document called &lt;code&gt;Resume_Final.docx&lt;/code&gt;. With my own humble contribution to science, the resulting file looks something like this (last retrieved on February 16, 2020):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_4.png&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that, this script assumes that all the associated files are co-located in the same directory. Please make sure to change the names of your input and output files in this script as desired before executing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool thing is that you can seamlessly edit your master file as you would normally do and run this script as frequently as you want to get the citations metrics inserted automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it! You have the exact same resume with the citation metrics inserted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;optional-step-3-automating-with-cron&#34;&gt;(Optional) Step 3: Automating with cron&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you would like to further fine-tune this process &lt;a href=&#34;http://ideophone.org/how-often-does-google-scholar-update/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;without the hassle of running the script every other day&lt;/a&gt;, you can optionally do that thanks to the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cronR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cronR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package. Fortunately, this step is dead easy as well, especially if you are already familar with R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, once you are able to install the &lt;code&gt;cronR&lt;/code&gt; package following instructions &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bnosac/cronR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, you can jump right into the &lt;code&gt;RStudio add-in&lt;/code&gt; section of that tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, if you want to execute the &lt;code&gt;Update_Resume.R&lt;/code&gt; script hourly, all you have to do is the following before pressing the &lt;code&gt;Create job&lt;/code&gt; button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Image_5.png&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you schedule the job above, it will update every hour whenever your computer is switched on (you can change the schedule any time). You can also save the resulting file in a shared or publicly accessible folder (such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive) and easily embed it on your personal website if you would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy automating! It&amp;rsquo;s not that difficult after all :)&lt;/p&gt;
