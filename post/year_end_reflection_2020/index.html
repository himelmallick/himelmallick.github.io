<p>The last day of 2020 is finally here. To bring this decade to a close, I thought I would take a moment to share some of the highlights from this year in the form of pictures and anecdotes.</p>

<p>As much as I would love to remember this year as a year of <code>setbacks and bottlenecks</code>, in retrospect, it has been packed with some very surprising yet noteworthy moments.</p>

<p>On a personal level, 2020 has been a year of many firsts, much as has been the case for the society in general where we have together achieved incredible things as a community despite challenging circumstances. From delivering vaccines in record time to abiding by the social distancing guidelines to adjusting to the <code>new normal</code>, we have come a stunningly long way in a short period of time, which I believe, prepares us well for a pandemic-proof future in 2021 and beyond.</p>

<p>Here are some things that went surprisingly well during the entire thriving process:</p>

<h2 id="new-year-resolutions">New year resolutions</h2>

<p>One of my new year resolutions in 2020 was to write at least one piece of writing every month (technical or non-technical). This seemed like a lofty goal at the outset but I am glad that I was able to break this seemingly hard-to-attain goal into manageable chunks to make it a reality. In my mind, this was a monumental personal milestone as it allowed me to build a decent writing habit which has been difficult historically.</p>

<p><img src="Image_1.jpg" alt="image info" /></p>

<h2 id="10000-steps-per-day">&gt;10000 steps per day</h2>

<p>Another seemingly unattainable habit (based on past experiences) was consistently hitting an average &gt;10,000 steps a day for an extended period of time (i.e. more than a few weeks or months), which I was able to achieve despite the almost year round lockdown. Considering all the obstacles that stood in the way this year, it was a truly transformative experience to start 2021 on a <code>lighter</code> note!</p>

<p><img src="Image_2.jpg" alt="image info" /></p>

<h2 id="getting-back-into-creative-writing">Getting back into creative writing</h2>

<p>Towards the end of the year, I was fortunate to enroll in a <code>screenwriting</code> class. Among other things, this was my best chance at getting back into creative writing. As a result of this experience, I was able to write a few short scripts in addition to a few amateur poems which was enough to eventually claw my way to get my writer’s groove back :)</p>

<p><img src="Image_3.jpg" alt="image info" /></p>

<h2 id="personal-commit-record">Personal commit record</h2>

<p>In the meantime, almost accidentally, I broke my own record of GitHub commits, which was more than all the previous years combined. I couldn&rsquo;t be more happy about this <code>unexpected</code> milestone!</p>

<p><img src="Image_4.jpg" alt="image info" /></p>

<h2 id="personal-peer-review-record">Personal peer-review record</h2>

<p>By the same token, I couldn&rsquo;t be more appreciative of the opportunity to give back to the scientific community through voluntary contributions in the form of peer-review activities. Consequently, I was able to break my own record of <a href="https://publons.com/researcher/1190507/himel-mallick/metrics/" target="_blank">Publons-verified peer-reviews</a>, which was again <code>accidentally</code> more than all previous years.</p>

<p><img src="Image_5.jpg" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Apart from these, there have been a few <code>first-of-its-kind</code> professional highlights this year as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>Completed my first internship as a mentor</li>
<li>Edited my first <a href="https://himelmallick.github.io/post/guest_editing_reflection/" target="_blank">special issue</a> as a lead editor</li>
<li>Published my first <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Maaslin2.html" target="_blank">Bioconductor package</a></li>
<li>Delivered my first <a href="https://twitter.com/Mallick_Himel/status/1260271590320885764" target="_blank">keynote presentation</a></li>
<li>Organized my first <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2021/invitedsessions.cfm" target="_blank">JSM invited session</a> (scheduled for JSM 2021)</li>
</ul>

<p>With that note, I would love to hear your highlights from the year, so be sure to leave a comment :)</p>

<p>Wishing you and yours a safe, healthy, and prosperous new year! Onwards and upwards!</p>
